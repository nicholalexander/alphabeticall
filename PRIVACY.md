### Privacy Policy

#### Welcome!
Hi there! Thanks for using our app. We want to keep things simple and clear when it comes to your privacy.

#### Your Data
We don’t collect any of your data. Nothing at all. Everything you do in the app stays on your device. There’s no tracking, no sending information to servers, and no sneaky stuff happening behind the scenes.

#### Open-Source Awesomeness
This app is open-source, which means anyone can look at the code and see how it works. If you’re curious, you can check it out [here](link-to-repository). We believe in being open and transparent because we care about your trust.

#### No Outside Connections
Our app doesn’t use any third-party tools or services. It’s just you and the app, working together locally on your device.

#### Updates
Since this is an open-source project, people might improve the app or make it better over time. If anything about this privacy policy changes, you’ll see it reflected in the source code.

#### Questions?
If you’re wondering about anything or just want to say hi, you can reach out through the contact details in the source repository. We’d love to hear from you!
